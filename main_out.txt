\caption{Regions assigned for spectral analysis. \emph{Left panel:} White contours in the left panel represent the [2, 3, 5, 7, 10]$\sigma$ detection limits in the 0.3--2.0 keV band from Chandra/ACIS. The slit-shaped regions (1.5 arcsec wide) represent the APO/DIS optical spectra, defined to align with the major axis of the galaxy and the major axis of the circumnuclear disk. The circular core region, shown in the zoomed image, has a 3~arcsec radius. The RGB background image was generated using the $gri$ observations from Pan-STARRS. \emph{Right:} Close-up view of the core regions, showing the apertures for optical 6dF spectra ($R=3.4$ arcsec), and the APO/DIS slit-spectra. The background image represents the flux intensity in the F475W band from HST/WFPC2.}
