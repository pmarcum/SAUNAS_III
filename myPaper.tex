\title{SAUNAS II: Discovery of Cross-shaped X-ray Emission and a Rotating Circumnuclear Disk \\in the Supermassive S0 Galaxy NGC 5084}

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Observational evidence suggests that supermassive black holes (SMBHs; $M_{\rm BH}=10^{6-9.5}$) are present at the core of most massive galaxies \citep{kormendy+2013araa51_511}. The accretion of material by SMBHs has been observed to be tightly connected with the evolution of the entire galaxy, enabling periods of nuclear activity in which the total luminosity of the galaxy is enhanced. 
%"modified" does not imply a direction - the luminosity could increase or decrease. Active Galactic Nuclei \citep[AGNs,][]{mulchaey+1996apj467_197} are powered by the release of gravitational energy in a compact accretion disk surrounding the SMBH at the core of the galaxy, generating emission across the whole electromagnetic spectrum \citep{heckman+2014araa52_589}.
